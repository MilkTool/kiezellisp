.description

null reference, e.g. `(? "to-upper")`. This is usually written as `?to-upper` 
and expanded by the lisp reader to the former expression.

.examples
(?to-upper "hello")
(?to-upper "hello")
(let obj (new :name "piet"))
(?name.to-upper obj)
(?city.to-upper obj)
:throws
(.city.to-upper obj)
