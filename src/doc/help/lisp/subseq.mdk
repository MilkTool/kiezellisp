(subseq seq start &key end count default)

.description
Returns a subsequence of `seq` starting at position `start` and continuing
to position `end` or until `count` elements have been yielded. If the sequence
is too short to yield `count` arguments and if `default` is supplied, the 
subsequence is padded by `default` elements.

.examples
(subseq (series 5) 2)
(subseq (series 5) 2 :count 7 :default 9999)
