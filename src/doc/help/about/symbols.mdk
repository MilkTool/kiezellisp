.index about:symbols
.description
If something in a lisp program is not a number, string or parenthesis, then it
probably is a symbol. It is just a name in a package (which is not entirely
unlike a namespace). Symbols may have a global value and/or a lexical value or
even no value at all. The value may be a simple value like a number or a string,
or a more complex value like a function.

.examples
(undef 'z)
'z
:d
(var z 123)
